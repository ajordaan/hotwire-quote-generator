# README

This quote/invoice generator was built by following [this excellent tutorial](https://www.hotrails.dev/turbo-rails) on building a CRUD app using hotwire and turbo.

I learned a great deal about hotwire and how to add it into a rails app to give a more SPA-like feeling, while following the best practices of a traditional rails app

To prevent mindless copy-pasting there are some things I did differently from the tutorial.

### Differences from the tutorial:

* Used Slim templates instead of ERB
